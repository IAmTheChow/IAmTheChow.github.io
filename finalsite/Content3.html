        <p class="SFS"> After doing lots of research on how a country can effect a students education I found that poorer countries especially in Africa end up with extremely low literacy and numeracy rates. They key reason for this is that because of the countries economic status they cannot afford to spend money on a better education system and because of this they can not educate anyone to the point where someone may be able to help the country out of this economic low. This leaves the country in a loop of poorly educated people and a poorly educated government. <br><br>

        In most developing countries, few children graduate from secondary school and many don’t even finish primary school. In Ghana, for example, only 50 percent of children complete grade 5, and of those, less than half can comprehend a simple paragraph. The UNESCO program Education for All, which as part of the Millennium Development Goals aims to provide free, universal access to primary schooling, has been successful in dramatically increasing enrollment. But, according to annual Education for All reports, many kids drop out before finishing school. Why don’t they stay? <br>
