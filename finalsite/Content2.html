			<h1>Computer Education</h1>
			<p style="font-size: 18.5px">Computer education is becoming more and more important in a growing world and although schools are making an effort in giving students options when it comes to their education they are still not all the way there. Many people lack the knowledge on how to even use simple programs like word which many businesses use this leaves some people stuck having to pay money to take online courses on how to use different software, this problem could be solved by simply making a basic level of computer education compulsory. Currently this does not exist in at least my school, the only way you can learn anything about computers is if you teach it to yourself or take the class in school and sacrifice another option that could have suited you better. Another problem is that many students do not find computers interesting at all which is of course fine but that leaves them with the mindset that they do not need to learn anything about them. Computer education is becoming more and more of a neccessity in the modern world and many people leaving school are finding themselves lost realizing that almost every job requires a computer.</p>
