			<p class="P1">University fees are very expensive in a good amount of the countries of the world. The image to the left shows the countries with the most expensive unversity education in terms of how much of a persons salary would be spent on university fees. In an ideal world where education would be easily accesable for everyone this would be at 0% but as shown here in some countries its as high as 92%. The reason this is the case if because the governments of the countries do not want to spend much money on education and would rather spend it on something else e.g. Military.</p>
			<p class="P2">Along with expensive school fees it is a question on whether the content being taught at secondary and primary schools is even the correct stuff to teach. Many students complain about the fact that they are not taught any important life skills like doing taxes and instead are left with skills that are useless to them. The problem with this is, is that because school are so large they have to support everyone individually and in order to do this they must teach everyone all the subjects in case someone still does not know what they want to do in the future</p>
			<p class="P3">Universities are well known for having expensive fees especially in countries like America but what is forgoten is the edcuation they give. Many people are complaining that the content taught at universities could be taught anywhere for free or could be found online, but even if this were to be the case you will not have a degree. The important thing about going to a university is getting a degree, when going to an employeer it would be of course useful to know everything needed but what they really look for is that degree whether you know the content or not. Is this fair? that's for you to decide.</p>
